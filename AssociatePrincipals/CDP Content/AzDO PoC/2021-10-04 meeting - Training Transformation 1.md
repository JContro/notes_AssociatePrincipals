## People
- Rebecca Tomlinson
- Lawrence Freeman
- Maria Robson
- Elmira Ahmedova


## Make trainers not feel lost <3
That's the aim, guys.


## Notes
- Trainers frustration: there is no vehicle to understand what is on agenda. 'Entertain' the cohort for 3 hours of self-learning
- Siloes: stuff is shared in sharepoints/personal devices/onedrives - are they already familiar with this? Lawrence: they are with Jira


### What do we want to test?
Process for creating Discover (self-learning) plans
- 9 3h discover sessions of self learning. What content will entertain them?
- What will I demonstrate? What will I get them to self learn?
- What videos could I delegate to people to help out with content? Guided 3h work
- 
 
## Outcomes
- Must carry on with 17th Sept - another meeting expected. Before that date, have a platform in place where trainers know what is expected. Trainers need to be on the journey, not be told what to do.
- trainers are directed by making a storyboard
	- different types of media/training videos
	- delegated bank of videos
- expert-led sessions are ring-fenced from interview time

Lawrence to create 3 session splits for all 5 practices
- must be at least x hours of videos (engaging content)

- 2 wildcard Discover sessions

To bring a level of confidence to trainers to make it feel more manageable and calm them down.

- We need to unlock their imagination, make sure they get it, they get their ideas.
- Maria's idea: start mapping split cohort discover phase into filling in 15/70 discover day phases
	- only 40 sessions left

## Personal Todos
- Lawrence to create 3 session splits for all 5 practices
- Get Lawrence's Discover spreadsheet into vertical AzDO experiment
- for each practice, how many sessions do you need for client placements, people/readiness team? -> Grey out those sessions from training
- talk to Martin set up the platform the right way
- 2021/10/18 3h in-person training team catch up
- start creating policies for visibility of cohort availability for different teams (readiness, people, HR, etc.)
