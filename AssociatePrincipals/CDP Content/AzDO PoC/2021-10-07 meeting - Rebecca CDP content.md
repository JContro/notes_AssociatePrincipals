## People
- [[Rebecca Tomlinson]]
- [[Jack Contro]]
- [[Maria Robson]]
- [[Elmira Ahmedova]]

## Notes
### Various types of video and support for trainers
- Jack mentioning that trainers will be provided with infra for content creation
- Jack mentioned that trainers **could be decoupled** from content creation
	- Becca agrees. concers about Sarah and Jacob being on board, extra resources, etc.
	- need to understand time allocation of the creative team
- Understand the different types of videos and how trainers can apply it -> this will help make the estimation of efforts (trainers, creative team, etc.)
- Camilla D. reviewing the reading content
	- we should align Camilla D. with what we are trying to do here
- Jack mentioned the decision trees
	- contact points
	- video type
- Albert's vidos could be the starting point for re-vamping the content to the expected standard
	- make the trainers feel proud of what they've done
	- the videos are a ready transcript, so this is not a throw-away work

### Single source of truth
- Comms between the traiening team
- Lawrence - roadmap, business plan and ROI -> this needs to be communicated to trainers
- Demonstrated to Becca the Wiki pages and mentioned how this can be the single source of truth, containing various decision diagrams, point of contact diagrams, etc.
	- Becca agreed to work with Elmira to update and transfer here
- Sharepoints are used by wider business, so we can't

### Documentation is a big blocker
- trainers might not even read any documentation at all
	- use Mermaid for maintainable diagramming of processes
	- Sharepoint at the moment is just a file dump - information is not consumable
- Roshan and Camilla are creating the latest guidelines in a document

## Outcomes

## Personal Todos

	- QA 4-5 types of 'gold-standard' sample videos
-  align Camilla D. with what we are trying to do
-  invite Sarah, Jacob and Camilla for the meeting on 18th October;
- idea: should we create a knowledge graph of people in Kubrick? how training, dev, senior teams relate to each other, main points of contact, etc.?
- single teams
	- single process for asking questions
	- process for setting up meetings
	- all these placed in diagrams
- Call with Loz + Becca + APs + Creative team
