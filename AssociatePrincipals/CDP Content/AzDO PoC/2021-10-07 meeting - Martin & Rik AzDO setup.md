## Notes

### cost analysis
- all three clouds -> 
	- what are the instances?
	- what are the costs??
- AAD is prod -> very expensive -> need to move it away
	- .cloud
	- .training
	- .consulting
		- migrate the CDP dev from AAD to .cloud
		- space for datalab to go to when moving this around -> trainers are logging in to the AAD to see the CDP Dev backlog
			- all the items will be lift and shifted
		- Work item numbers are recycled when you create a new instance -> things when moved, are moved relative to one each other. Items may get a new number, but solvable
			- Martin confirmed that e.g. 2 projects with 2 separate boards are able to be linked -> possible to link work items -> good for Emma and Rebecca
		- what if I want to extend and do other things?
			- service connection considerations

		- if people are in as stakeolders, there is almost no cost
		- Sharepoint can be interlinked with AzDO
			- Sharepoint is best for file search, e.g. word search in pdf
			- wiki will only have a file as an embed
			- documents and diagrams -> point to where it lives on Sharepoint
			- treat wiki as a knowledge base to find the things
			- if it is possible to tag stuff in Sharepoint, then possible to filter info via wiki -> feature retired
		- Teams channels for notifications only
		- get rid of files -> Rebecca doesn't have to go through everything for the MVP
			- get feedback from trainers and then gradually migrate


### Extensions
- precursors and successors (not parent -> child)
	- e.g. I need X to do Y, before Z does A
	- can break relationships and reput them together, analyse externally in excel and then sync it back with AzDO
	- create controlled query export in excell (where story cells go into, and this will create stories)

## Outcomes
- wikis
- work items
- access permissions (stakeholder, apart from APs & Co)
- timelines
- appropriate supporting extensions
	- e.g. dependencies -> timelines as a calendar view
	- reference related smartsheet items in AzDO -> drop hyperlink to work item
	- iteration parts of months
		- group things by months as initial granularity
- iteration parts in months
		- dependencies and time dependencies in place
	- there are exports/imports with smartsheets and AzDO -> will be easy to migrate
	- guest invites can be done via TF - improve the code base
- Maria created the channel in Kubrick CDP Programme - **Training Transformation**

## Personal Todos
- get Teams channels organised
- get the bits from Lawrence 
- KAdv should be moved as well
