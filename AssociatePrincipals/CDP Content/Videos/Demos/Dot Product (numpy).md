***

## Speakers
Henry 

## Creative team members
[[Jacob Zatorski]]
[[Sarah Collins]]

## Equipment
Office studio
2 cameras
mic lights
computer with jupyter notebook on it

## Script points

- The speaker introduces what we are going to be doing. 
- Why do we care about knowing what a dot product is? 
	- See two physics points in jupyter notebook or come up with another relevant use case!
- Explain what the dot product of 1d vectors is -> we will add some pop up maths in the video while you talk to the camera to make it clear
- Explains that we already know what jupyter notebooks are (referencing that this is not the first video of the course)
- Pip installs the numpy library (be in a virtualenv please) 
- Create two sample arrays 
- Performs the dot product on them
- Show the pure math calculation
	- Explain how more convenient it is to use a library sucha s numpy cos you don't have to write out the code yourself
- Summary

### Extra info
- The video should be very brief and it's purpose is just to demonstrate a style of video
- The presenter should be super engaging and enthusiastic about the topic
- No reading from a script - it really ruins the presentation. Can use bullet points at best
- A jupyter notebook will be provided to reproduce in the video

## Good points

- Great video quality
- Fantastic sound
- Great speaker - confident and really engaging
- Really love the bubble at the bottom of the screen 
- Fantastic outro

## To be improved

- Sometimes the wording is inaccurate, QA process from trainers will find these out
- The pop ups on screen are incorrect mathematically - these need to be designed and QAd from the trainers
