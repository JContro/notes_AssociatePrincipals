# Presentation with slides

## Description
The presenter is in front of a green screen and is reading off the slides. The effect is the reader on the slides. 

- The slides (kubrick branded) have the content on the left
- the presenter is looking at the slides - through the camera
- The speaker holds the controller to move the slides forward
- The speaker is filmed in a studio setting with 1 good quality camera and good microfone 
- Post editing can make the speaking more fluid (when there are longer pauses, or add break points when things are too quick)


## Examples

- Old example
	https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started/lecture/shQW1/m1-1-2-objects 
	- This guy is great, but could be a little less static (he's standing with his arms down)
- New one
	- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu4yvq-g7_y")
	Now this is actually more dynamic than the speaker on the slides and can be edited in a more fluid way
