# Presentation with slides

## Description
The presenter is in front of a green screen and is reading off the slides. The effect is the reader on the slides. 

- The slides (kubrick branded) have the content on the left
- the presenter is looking at the slides - through the camera
- The speaker holds the controller to move the slides forward
- The speaker is filmed in a studio setting with 1 good quality camera and good microfone 
- Post editing can make the speaking more fluid (when there are longer pauses, or add break points when things are too quick)
