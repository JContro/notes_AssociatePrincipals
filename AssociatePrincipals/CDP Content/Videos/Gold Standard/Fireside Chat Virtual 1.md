# Fireside Chat Virtual

## Description

A conversation between a student and a tech lead about a topic. It should be informal 
Question answers that cover intricacies, not the obvious introductory material on the topic.

It can include screenshares with some coding

## Examples

- This is a bit too formal even - but loads of cool takeaways [https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/On-NET/C-9-Language-Features](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/On-NET/C-9-Language-Features "https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/on-net/c-9-language-features")
-  Basically u can look at any Channel9 video online…
	They all have a overly formal intro to each other which we don’t need to do as we already have formal “this is Me” intro videos - so I’d go straight in with a Hi Elmira or Hi Lozza,
	But actually - maybe just inspire us with some ideas! What do u think would make a cool video format for learning?!?

## Use case

- Showcase two technologies. The lead may explain when you would use one, and not the other one. 
- Showcasing a common misuse of a technology (a bad practice, what are the consequences?) 
- A topic that is very hard to explain in just words, you need some questions that mimick a normal learners response
	- why are you using a dictionary instead of a list here? really point to the intricacies of the code, or practice. 



## Pros
- This format mimicks the classroom experience
- It's like a conversation, the listener is more engaged. They can put themselves in the shoes of whoever is in that virtual call
- We can use consultants that are on bench/training
- No professional filming required

## Cons
Trainers are involved in the filming ->  (but it could be a KA or AP)

## Acceptance criteria
- The student is very interested
- The student asks many questions 

## Creative involvment
### Equipment
Home setup
	Do we add Kubrick branding? 
	Send webcam + mic? + light
	
### Man hours
- Editing

## Process
Trainer chooses a topic
Trainer prepares a demo
QA of the demo from another trainer
Consultant selected to be suitable for the demo (interested and capable)
Set up the equipment
Test run through with lead + consultant
	Pick up the questions that are really good and good options
2nd run through
Editing of the video (footage from both sessions)


## Best practices
THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT AND NONE SHOULD BE SKIPPED -  READ ALL
- Have the start and end of the videos polished 
- Visual Aids
	- Powerpoint slides shown and spoke over (kubrick branded)
	- Visual pop ups that help the listener understand what the speaker is talking about (post prod edits)
- When reading off notes - have the notes on the screen so that you don't look away from the webca,
- Find a balance between a nice informal chat at the start, but avoid pinning the video at a given time/ associated roles
- Bring great energyand enthusiasm for the subject
- Bring a good example on why knowing this *thing* is useful and relevant
- Great to have a final summary at the end from the interviewer on what was learned in this chat
- Add time codes (post prod) to help people navigate easily the content, particularly important on longer videos
- Content should be directed by the trainers, with the interviewee going through all the points already laid out by the trainer
