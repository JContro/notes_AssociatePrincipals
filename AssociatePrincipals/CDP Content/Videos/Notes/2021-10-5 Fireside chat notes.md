Notes from our current meeting

**bad**
No slides for visual aid -> makes it look a bit random
show the figma website
Needs to be cut at the end 
Probably needs a Kubrick thing to start on 

Notes to bottom left - Elmira was looking down 
	notes should be on screen

The introduction can't be focused on job titles and reference points in time
No time codes -> this might not be something in the CDP platform yet 

**good**
Really good energy from the speakers 
	significant enthusiasm
	clear speaking
Really good example -> why do we use BPM
Summary - from Elmira
Informal nature of the chat 

More:
The contents should be directed by the trainers
	These are the points you need to cover
	
	
## Best practices
THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT AND NONE SHOULD BE SKIPPED -  READ ALL
- Have the start and end of the videos polished 
- Visual Aids
	- Powerpoint slides shown and spoke over (kubrick branded)
	- Visual pop ups that help the listener understand what the speaker is talking about (post prod edits)
- When reading off notes - have the notes on the screen so that you don't look away from the webca,
- Find a balance between a nice informal chat at the start, but avoid pinning the video at a given time/ associated roles
- Bring great energyand enthusiasm for the subject
- Bring a good example on why knowing this *thing* is useful and relevant
- Great to have a final summary at the end from the interviewer on what was learned in this chat
- Add time codes (post prod) to help people navigate easily the content, particularly important on longer videos
- Content should be directed by the trainers, with the interviewee going through all the points already laid out by the trainer
