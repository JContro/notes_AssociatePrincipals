## Notes
**bad**
No slides for visual aid -> makes it look a bit random
show the figma website
Needs to be cut at the end 
Probably needs a Kubrick thing to start on 

Notes to bottom left - Elmira was looking down 
	notes should be on screen

The introduction can't be focused on job titles and reference points in time
No time codes -> this might not be something in the CDP platform yet 

**good**
Really good energy from the speakers 
	significant enthusiasm
	clear speaking
Really good example -> why do we use BPM
Summary - from Elmira
Informal nature of the chat 

More:
The contents should be directed by the trainers
	These are the points you need to cover
