## People
[[Victoria Norman]]

## Notes
 We want to catalog the decisions we made and what the outcomes were
 Cronological order
 Explicit and implicit
 
 **Goal**
- Learning excercise
	- can we learn from this for new projects
	
- Are there high level things that are still hanging loose? 
 
 ### Proposals
 Get people to add points in time 

- do we limit who is involved? 
	- Richard
	- Musaab
	- Lisa

Florenca -> can have some really good inputs on the design process



## Outcomes
Vicky Jack Matt Emma first stab at timeline (lucidchart)
