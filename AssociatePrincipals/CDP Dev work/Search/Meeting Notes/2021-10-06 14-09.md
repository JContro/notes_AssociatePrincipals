It's not in the MVP, but something we would like to have sooner rather than later

Google style free text on everything on CDP 

Typical search engine
- **crawler**, looks at all the content that is available
	- Word stemming
	- NLP 
The output of the crawler is an index

The Go program is then searching the index

Go can have a file system compiled into the program 
This adds to the performance of the executable

#### Steps
Create the crawler
	goes through all the pages and gets all the text
	
most useful POC on the transcripts 


## Outcomes
Write a crawler 
- can be in Go
- Alta vista crawler
- s3 crawler 

Vicky - from an s3 location to the url 

For each link you get the header + 2 sentence summary 


## Personal Todos
Give tickets to myself
Summary for Matt
s3 loc to Vicky

start web crawler of s3 in go or AWS
